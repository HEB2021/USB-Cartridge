So a little about USB Cartridge is that im still as of writting this, im still designing the first cartridge in CAD.

The basical insipiration is an IBM tape library because I think those are awesome but rather expensive. So my idea is to make a cartridge that can hold a USB device there most likely wont be a robot arm to move the cartridges.

But they have some other Pros which I think help their case
They would be more difficult to misplace as they are larger
They would be only marginally more expensive than a USB stick
They can be upgraded as many times as required
The Cartridges will be insanly easy to repair from damage
They can be stacked for easy storage
They are easy to make as you simply 3D Print the cartridge

Some Cons are
They cost a little more than USB sticks
They are physically larger which means they do require more space
They wont be able to be plugged into a USB port like usual disks
They might be fragile but once the first is printed this may be removed from cons

Other than that I think that this Cartridge idea might actually have the power to go somewhere more information will be added as we go but for now I think this is good enough :)
